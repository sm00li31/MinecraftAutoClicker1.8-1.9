## Autoclicker is a program that can automate quick and frequent left or right mouse clicks without your participation. In Minecraft autoclicker can be useful when mining any resources, digging mines and perform other routine actions. Autoclicker is easy to use, just set intervals at which you will need to click and select the mouse button (left or right).
